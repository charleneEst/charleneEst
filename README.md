- 👋 Dear visitor, I’m Charlène Estrada.
- 👀 In 2020, I completed a PhD in Molecular biology in the field of cancer (melanoma) research in Dr Celio Pouponnot & Dr Alain Eychène group at Curie Institute (France), where I had the opportunity to perform proteomics/interactomics experiments, from bench to data analysis using an in-house software developed by Curie Institute : MyProMS. 
Curious by nature and highly interested in data analysis and IT, I have recently completed a Master in Bioinformatics, where I learned to program in both python and R, and dive into statistics. 
In the frame of this training, I worked with Pr Kristian Pietras group at Lund University (Sweden). My project aimed at developing a pipeline of analysis for single-cell RNAseq data to decipher fibroblasts heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer.  
- 💞️ I’m looking for job opportunities to work on single-cell RNAseq projects, in the field of oncology.
